# Resume Parsing using BERT
This repository contains code and resources for resume parsing using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The project aims to extract structured information from resumes using pre-trained BERT models. It includes a sample dataset, code for model training, and instructions for using the trained model for your own task.
